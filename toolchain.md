# Toolchain

Project programs and direct packages from manifests.

## Programs

| Program | How to install | Why here | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mise | brew / curl, then `mise install` | Pinned tool versions | https://github.com/jdx/mise |
| cargo-cache | mise | `just cache` / `just cache-autoclean`; the shared cargo home fills up | https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/cargo-cache |
| cargo-nextest | global (cargo install) | Parallel test runner | https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest |
| node | mise | commitlint for `just lint-commits` and the commit-msg hook, and the macOS design-token generator and checks; node-based checks live in Just and CI only | https://github.com/nodejs/node |
| rustc | mise (through rustup) | Rust compiler; `mise.toml` pins the one version local work, CI and release builds use | https://github.com/rust-lang/rust |
| cargo | with rustc | Rust build and dependencies | https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo |
| just | cargo install just / brew | Command recipes | https://github.com/casey/just |
| cargo-dist | mise | Generates `release.yml` and builds the release tarballs (`just dist-generate`, `just package`) | https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist |
| git-cliff | mise | Writes the `CHANGELOG.md` entry from `cliff.toml` (`scripts/release.sh`), and the macOS app's release notes from `desktop/cliff.toml` | https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff |
| xcodegen | mise | Generates `desktop/macos/Ketch.xcodeproj` from `project.yml` (`just macos-app`, `just macos-test`) | https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen |
| Xcode | global (App Store / developer.apple.com) | Builds and tests the macOS app (`xcodebuild`); 26 or later | https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ |
| rust-std aarch64-apple-darwin | rustup (`scripts/xcframework.sh` adds it to the pinned toolchain when missing) | `ketch-ffi`'s arm64 XCFramework (`just xcframework`) | https://github.com/rust-lang/rust |
| swift-format | with Xcode (`xcrun swift-format`) | Formats and lints the macOS app's Swift | https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format |
| notarytool, stapler | with Xcode (`xcrun`) | Notarise and staple the macOS app and its `.dmg` (`release-apple-desktop.yml`) | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/customizing-the-notarization-workflow |
| hdiutil, codesign, spctl | with macOS | Build the app's `.dmg` (`release-apple-desktop.yml`, in pyrlyn/ci), sign it, and assess what Gatekeeper will decide | https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution |
| generate_appcast | with the Sparkle package (`build/SourcePackages/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/`) | Writes and signs the macOS app's appcast (`release-apple-desktop.yml`, in pyrlyn/ci) | https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle |
| cargo-fuzz | mise | Builds and runs the libFuzzer targets in `fuzz/` (`just fuzz`) | https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz |
| rustc nightly | rustup (`rustup toolchain install nightly`) | Only for `cargo +nightly fuzz`; every build stays on the `mise.toml` pin | https://github.com/rust-lang/rust |
| release-plz | local only | `release-plz update` preview; no longer run in CI (bump.yml releases) | https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz |
| ketch | see its README | Installs swarfr | https://github.com/pyrlyn/ketch |
| swarfr | `ketch` | Lossless cleanup of `target/` after tests | https://github.com/listepo/swarfr |
| mandoc | ships with macOS; `apt install mandoc` on Linux | `just lint-man` checks the generated man pages | https://mandoc.bsd.lv |
| uniffi-bindgen-cs | mise (`cargo:` from git, PR #176's commit) | C# bindings for `ketch-ffi` (`just csharp`); no release supports UniFFI 0.32 yet | https://github.com/NordSecurity/uniffi-bindgen-cs |
| .NET SDK | mise | Builds and runs the C# binding's test (`just csharp-test`), the Windows app's tests (`just windows-app-test`) and, on Windows, the WinUI app (`ketch-win-app` CI job) | https://github.com/dotnet/sdk |
| valac, Meson, Ninja, json-glib | the distribution's packages (`apt install valac meson ninja-build libjson-glib-dev`); mise has no valac | `just capi-test`: builds and runs `ketch-capi`'s Vala test; Linux CI only | https://vala.dev |

## cargo

| Package | Where | Source | Why here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arbitrary | local (`fuzz/`) | https://crates.io/crates/arbitrary | Structured fuzz input |
| assert_cmd | local | https://crates.io/crates/assert_cmd | Rust dependency |
| assert_fs | local | https://crates.io/crates/assert_fs | Rust dependency |
| bzip2 | local | https://crates.io/crates/bzip2 | Rust dependency |
| cbindgen | local (`crates/ketch-capi`, dev) | https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen | Generates `crates/ketch-capi/include/ketch.h`; a drift test fails when the committed header is stale |
| clap | local | https://crates.io/crates/clap | CLI |
| clap_complete | local | https://crates.io/crates/clap_complete | Rust dependency |
| clap_mangen | local | https://crates.io/crates/clap_mangen | ketch's man pages, one per command (`src/man.rs`) |
| console | local (Windows only) | https://crates.io/crates/console | Switches on virtual terminal processing so legacy conhost shows colour instead of escape codes; already in the tree through indicatif |
| crossterm | local | https://crates.io/crates/crossterm | Terminal |
| diesel | local | https://crates.io/crates/diesel | SQLite ORM |
| diesel_migrations | local | https://crates.io/crates/diesel_migrations | SQLite migrations |
| dirs | local | https://crates.io/crates/dirs | Rust dependency |
| dunce | local | https://crates.io/crates/dunce | Canonicalize without Windows UNC prefixes |
| flate2 | local | https://crates.io/crates/flate2 | Rust dependency |
| hex | local | https://crates.io/crates/hex | Rust dependency |

| libc | local (`crates/ketch-capi`) | https://github.com/rust-lang/libc | `malloc`/`free` for the strings `ketch-capi` returns, so GLib's `g_free` can release them |
| libsqlite3-sys | local | https://crates.io/crates/libsqlite3-sys | `bundled` compiles SQLite into the binary. Linking the system one would make ketch's single-binary promise depend on what the host happens to ship, and the release builds both macOS architectures where that answer differs. |

| lzma-rs | local | https://crates.io/crates/lzma-rs | Rust dependency |
| octocrab | local | https://crates.io/crates/octocrab | `ketch registry push` talks to GitHub through octocrab rather than the ureq client the sources use: it needs forks, refs, contents and pull requests, which octocrab already types and paginates. It is async, hence tokio for a runtime to block on; everything else in ketch stays synchronous. |
| pathdiff | local | https://crates.io/crates/pathdiff | Relative path between two paths |
| predicates | local | https://crates.io/crates/predicates | Rust dependency |
| pretty_assertions | local | https://crates.io/crates/pretty_assertions | Rust dependency |
