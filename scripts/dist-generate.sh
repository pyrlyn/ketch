# Regenerate .github/workflows/release.yml from dist-workspace.toml, then patch
# in what dist has no setting for:
#
# - dist's CODESIGN_* secret names mapped to the MACOS_* secrets this
#   repository holds. CODESIGN_IDENTITY is not a secret: .github/build-setup.yml
#   discovers it on macOS runners.
# - .github/build-check.yml (notarisation and the smoke test) after `dist
#   build`, before each target's artifacts are uploaded.
# - An aggregate `SHA256SUMS` beside the tarballs, and their sizes in the
#   release notes. `install.sh`, `install.ps1` and every `ketch self upgrade`
#   already installed read `SHA256SUMS`; dist's own aggregate is `sha256.sum`.
#
# Invoked by `just dist-generate`. Do not hand-edit release.yml; change
# dist-workspace.toml, .github/build-setup.yml or .github/build-check.yml and
# re-run this.
#
# allow-dirty = ["ci"] is set so `dist plan` / `dist build` accept the patched
# workflow. That same flag makes bare `dist generate` skip writing release.yml,
# so this script briefly clears it, generates, then restores the file.
