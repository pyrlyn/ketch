#
#   scripts/release.sh [patch|minor|major] [--dry-run|--local]
#
# The version in Cargo.toml is the version to release. It is raised only when
# that version is already tagged. This script never pushes and never tags: the
# Bump workflow (pyrlyn/ci bump.yml) runs it with --local, opens a pull
# request with the version commit, rebase-merges it once the required checks
# pass, then tags the commit that landed on main, creates the draft release and
# dispatches release.yml, where dist uploads the tarballs and publishes it.
#
#   (none)     start the Bump workflow (gh workflow run bump.yml -f level=...)
#   --dry-run  print the version that would be released; change nothing
#   --local    make the version commit and stop (what bump.yml runs)
#
# The version is written in one place and read as the tag: `ketch self upgrade`
# compares the running binary's version against the release tag. Bumping it by
# hand in an ordinary commit is what this script exists to stop.
