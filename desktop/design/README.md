# Design tokens

`tokens.json` is the one source of every colour, size, radius, font, shadow
and animation the macOS app uses, and of the brand subset (accent, status
colours, spacing, radii, type scale) the Windows and Linux apps share, with
native surfaces of their own. Everything else is generated from it:

| Output | What it is | Who reads it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generated/Tokens.swift` | `Tokens.Colors…`, `Tokens.Space…`, `Tokens.Typography…` as SwiftUI values; colours follow light, dark and Increase Contrast without an asset catalog | the app (`desktop/macos/`) |
| `generated/KetchTokens.xaml` | a XAML `ResourceDictionary`: colours (a `Color` and a `SolidColorBrush` each) in `ThemeDictionaries` keyed `Light`, `Dark` and `HighContrast` (the last as `SystemColor*` references, see below); spacing, `CornerRadius` and type-scale sizes, weights and pixel line heights outside them. Brand tokens only | the Windows app |
| `generated/ketch-tokens.css` | a GTK stylesheet: libadwaita's `--accent-bg-color`, `--accent-fg-color`, `--accent-color`, `--success-color`, `--warning-color`, `--error-color` and `--destructive-color` set from the brand colours, and every brand token as a `--ketch-*` custom property; dark and high-contrast values in `prefers-color-scheme` / `prefers-contrast` media queries. Brand tokens only | the Linux app |
| `../macos/DESIGN.md` front matter | the YAML block at the top, in the [DESIGN.md format](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) | coding agents, the DESIGN.md linter |
| `preview.html`, between `BEGIN/END GENERATED TOKENS` | CSS variables and a token index | the review page |

Which tokens leave macOS is the `BRAND` list in `build.mjs`. Glass, wash,
elevation, blur, motion, the macOS layout sizes and the preset tints stay in
Swift, the preview and DESIGN.md. Font families are not exported: each
platform uses its own. Windows has no dark high-contrast theme: a contrast
theme is the user's own palette (Aquatic, Desert, Dusk, Night sky), and the
`highContrast` hex is macOS ink for a light background. So XAML's
`HighContrast` dictionary holds no hex; it references WinUI's `SystemColor*`
resources (`XAML_HIGH_CONTRAST` in `build.mjs`, after Microsoft's
[contrast-themes pairings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/accessibility/high-contrast-themes),
checked 2026-10-03), and `contrast.mjs` does not check those pairs.
`highContrast` and `highContrastDark` are Swift and CSS only.

The prose of `DESIGN.md` and the rest of `preview.html` are hand-written.

## Change a token

1. Edit `tokens.json`. It is [W3C DTCG 2025.10](https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/):
   - A colour is `{"colorSpace": "srgb", "components": [r, g, b], "alpha": a, "hex": "#rrggbb"}`
     with components in 0–1. `hex` is optional, but when present it must match
     the components — the generator refuses a mismatch, so change both.
   - Appearance variants go in
     `"$extensions": {"com.github.pyrlyn.ketch": {"dark": …, "highContrast": …, "highContrastDark": …}}`.
     A missing one falls back: high-contrast dark → dark → light,
     high-contrast → light.
   - An alias (`"{color.accent.default}"`) resolves in the same appearance it is
     read in, so a component that points at the accent gets the dark accent in
     dark mode.
   - Dimensions are `{"value": 16, "unit": "px"}`; durations
     `{"value": 180, "unit": "ms"}`.
2. Regenerate: `just design-tokens` (or `node desktop/design/build.mjs`
   from the repository root after `just deps`).
3. Open `preview.html` in a browser and check both themes. The switches at the
   top toggle Light / Dark, Increase contrast, Reduce transparency and Reduce
   motion; a query string opens it in a given state, e.g.
   `preview.html?theme=dark&contrast=more`.
4. Run the checks: `just design-check`.
5. Commit `tokens.json` together with everything it regenerated.

A new token group needs no generator change as long as it uses a type the
generator knows (`color`, `dimension`, `number`, `typography`, `shadow`,
`transition`); another type fails the build with the token's path.

## Checks

`just design-check` (also part of `just check`, and the `design` job in CI):

- **Drift**: regenerates and fails if any generated file changed, i.e. someone
  edited a generated file or forgot to regenerate. Running the generator twice
  never produces a diff.
- **Contrast**: `contrast.mjs` checks every text/background pair the
  components use, in light, dark and both high-contrast appearances, against
  WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text and UI glyphs). The background is
  what the text really sits on: material tints composited over the canvas base,
  alone and under the wash at `opacity.washMax` (each gradient stop, plain and
  under each hill), worst case kept. `node desktop/design/contrast.mjs --verbose`
  prints every pair. Add a pair to `PAIRS` there when a component puts text on
  a new surface.
- **DESIGN.md lint**: `designmd lint` from `@google/design.md`; errors fail,
  warnings do not.

Everything runs offline after `npm ci`.

## Token names

The names below are the contract with the app and with the Figma library that
mirrors it: keep a Figma variable's path the same as the token's. A path
`color.accent.ink` is `Tokens.Colors.Accent.ink` in Swift and
`--color-accent-ink` in CSS. Values live in `tokens.json`; the token index at
the bottom of `preview.html` and the `DESIGN.md` front matter list them too.
Every colour has light, dark, high-contrast and high-contrast dark values
(a missing one falls back as described above).

| Group | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| `color.accent.*` | `default`, `pressed`, `subtle`, `on`, `ink` |
| `color.text.*` | `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` |
| `color.status.*` | `installed`, `installedSubtle`, `update`, `updateSubtle`, `busy`, `busySubtle`, `warning`, `warningSubtle`, `error`, `errorSubtle` |
| `color.background.*` | `base`, `washStart`, `washEnd`, `washHill`, `washDeep` |
| `color.glass.*` | `window`, `regular`, `frost`, `control`, `elevated`, `clear`, `stroke`, `highlight`, `shade`, `solidRegular`, `solidElevated` |
| `color.shadow.*` | `drop`, `window` |
| `color.*` | `scrim`, `separator`, `focusRing` |
| `color.fill.*` | `control`, `hover`, `track` |
| `color.preset.tint.*` | `sky`, `mint`, `sand`, `rose`, `lilac`, `smoke` |
| `color.preset.accent.*` | `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `graphite` |
| `opacity.*` | `wash`, `washMax`, `tint`, `tintDark` |
| `space.*` | `xxs`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `xxl`, `xxxl`, `huge` |
| `radius.*` | `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `full` |
| `size.*` | `sidebarWidth`, `rowHeight`, `toolbarHeight`, `iconSm`, `iconMd`, `iconLg`, `appIcon`, `badgeHeight`, `progressHeight`, `controlHeight`, `menuBarWidth`, `contentMaxWidth`, `hairline` |
| `blur.*` | `regular`, `elevated`, `clear` |
| `typography.*` | `display`, `title`, `title2`, `headline`, `body`, `callout`, `caption`, `overline`, `badge`, `mono` |
| `elevation.*` | `level0`, `level1`, `level2`, `level3`, `level4`, `lift`, `window` |
| `motion.*` | `instant`, `quick`, `standard`, `gentle`, `emphasized` |
| `component.*` | `buttonPrimary`, `buttonSecondary`, `packageRow`, `card`, `sheet`, `sidebar`, `menuBarExtra`, `badge`, `progress` |

`color.preset.*` are the swatches in Settings → Appearance, not colours for
views. The Liquid glass palette renamed the canvas mesh `meshTide`, `meshIris`,
`meshDawn` and `meshMist` to `washStart`, `washEnd`, `washHill` and
`washDeep`; nothing else was renamed. Update this table in the same change
as `tokens.json`.
