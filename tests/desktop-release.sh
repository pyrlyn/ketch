# The macOS app's releases share this repository with the CLI's, and the
# CLI's installers follow /releases/latest. This holds both sides apart:
#
# - release-apple-desktop.yml is dispatch-only and a thin caller of the
#   org-level pyrlyn/ci release-apple-desktop.yml, pinned by commit SHA,
#   with exactly the org secrets it needs, by name, and the desktop-v tag
#   prefix; that workflow checks the version, the secrets and the placeholder
#   Sparkle key, and creates every release with make_latest=false;
# - the CLI's release tooling never takes a desktop-v tag for its own.
