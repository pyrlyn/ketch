//! Conventional Commit rules shared by local hooks and CI.

// Commit format is conventional commits, exactly as config-conventional
// defines them: the default type enum already covers every type this repo
// uses, and release-plz reads the same `feat:`/`fix:`/`!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`
// grammar to decide the version bump. Local rules would drift from both, so
// there are none for the format.
//
// The one local rule is authorship, which config-conventional has no opinion
// on. AGENTS.md makes the human the only author, while an agent's harness
// adds a Co-Authored-By trailer or a "Generated with …" line by default — so a
// rule the agent has to remember becomes one the commit has to pass. Only an
// emoji may precede "Generated", so prose that quotes the phrase still passes.
// The optional U+FE0F is the variation selector that makes an emoji render
// in colour; it is invisible, so it is spelled as an escape.
