//! Putting the ketch bin directory on PATH.

//! On Unix that means a block in bash, zsh or fish startup files. On Windows
//! it means the user environment (`HKCU\\Environment\\Path`); the same shell
//! edits still exist for Git Bash.
//!
//! This is the only code in ketch that writes outside the ketch root, and it
//! runs only when the user asks for it — `ketch path install`, or
//! `ketch doctor --fix`. Everything it adds sits between two markers so it can
//! be found again, rewritten in place, and taken back out without guessing.
//!
//! On Windows it also switches completion on, which `self install` and
//! `ketch completions --install` ask for: a block in the PowerShell profiles
//! that dot-sources the completion script, and doskey macros for cmd.exe
//! loaded through `Command Processor\AutoRun`. Both are taken back out by
//! `ketch self uninstall`.
