//! that holds a file being replaced — it asks the [`Decider`] its caller put in
//! [`crate::report::Ctx`]. The `ketch` binary answers with a prompt on the
//! terminal; a graphical front end answers with a sheet or a dialog; a test
//! answers from a script. The default, [`NoDecider`], answers nothing, which is
