//! Line diffs between two texts, as `ketch registry push` shows them.
//!
//! A diff of two package files is small and needs no library for: the whole
//! point is a readable unified rendering of what changed between the
//! registry's copy and the local one, not a patch anyone applies. The
//! algorithm is a longest-common-subsequence table over lines, walked
//! forward into an edit script. On inputs of a few dozen lines the
//! quadratic table costs a few kilobytes, and the code stays short enough
//! to audit in one read — which is why no diff crate was added, and why a
//! linear-space Myers, whose only virtue is surviving files orders of
//! magnitude larger than a package file, would buy nothing here.
//!
//! Lines are compared as `str::lines` splits them, so `"a"` and `"a\n"`
//! diff as equal and no `\ No newline at end of file` marker is ever shown.
//! A CRLF-versus-LF difference likewise does not appear, which suits a diff
//! that a person reads and nothing ever applies.
