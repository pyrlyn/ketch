//! ketch-core — everything ketch does besides parsing its command line.
//!
//! Resolving a name to a manifest, fetching and verifying a release, unpacking
//! it into the store, linking it onto `PATH` and recording what happened all
//! live here, so the `ketch` binary is only the clap surface and the thin
//! command bodies that call into this crate. It is a separate crate so a
//! second front end can link the same pipeline without the CLI.
//!
//! It prints nothing and reads nothing. What it has to say — stages, progress,
//! warnings — goes out as `report::Event`s to the `report::Reporter` the front
//! end hands in through `report::Ctx`, and the front end decides how it looks.
//! What it has to ask goes to the `decide::Decider` in the same `Ctx`.
