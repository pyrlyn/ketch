//! Reading a package's changelog, from either of the two places one lives.
//!
//! Projects record what changed in one of two ways, and most do both
//! inconsistently: a `CHANGELOG.md` committed to the repository and shipped
//! inside the release, and the notes attached to the release itself. ketch
//! already has the second — every `Release` carries `notes` — and the first is
//! sitting in the store next to the binary that was installed from it.
//!
//! The file is preferred when it exists, because reading it needs no network
//! and it is the version the user actually has. Falling back to release notes
//! covers every project that keeps its history only on the forge.
//!
//! Nothing here trusts the file's structure. A changelog is prose someone else
//! wrote; the section matcher takes what it recognises and says plainly when it
//! recognises nothing, rather than guessing a range and printing the wrong
//! release's history.
