//! ketch-ffi — `ketch-core` exported through UniFFI, for front ends written in
//! another language that link the core in-process: the SwiftUI app first, a
//! Windows front end later, from the same Rust and the same generated
//! metadata.
//!
//! The surface is coarse on purpose. One object, [`KetchCore`], with one
//! method per thing a person does — list what is installed, search, see what
//! is outdated, install, upgrade, uninstall, pin, roll back, prune, read a
//! changelog or a package's info or history, run the doctor and its fix, see
//! and set up `PATH`, refresh the registry, read the configuration —
//! returning plain records ([`records`]). Each is a thin call into the same
//! core code the CLI command runs, so the two cannot drift apart. The core's types stay unannotated, so
//! nothing here constrains how they change; the price is a conversion per
//! record, tested in each module. What the core says while it works reaches a
//! foreign [`Reporter`], what it asks reaches a foreign [`Decider`], and a
//! [`CancelToken`] stops an operation; all three are adapters onto the core's
//! own traits ([`callbacks`]). Errors are one enum, [`KetchError`].
//!
//! The reporter, decider and token are passed to each call, not to the
//! constructor. An app shows each operation where it was started — a progress
//! row in one screen, a sheet in another — so one `KetchCore` serving two
//! screens at once has to tell their events and questions apart, and a
//! reporter fixed at construction would send both to the same place. Calls
//! that change nothing take only a reporter; `root` and `installed` read a
//! file and take none.
//!
//! Threading follows the rules the core sets for a long-running host. Every
//! method is synchronous and blocks for as long as the work takes, so a caller
//! runs it off its UI thread. Each call builds its `Config` and opens the log
//! afresh, so an edit to `config.toml` is seen by the next call. A call that
//! changes the install tree holds `state::Lock` for its whole run; a second one
//! from any thread or process fails at once with [`KetchError::Busy`] rather
//! than waiting. `ketch registry push` is not exported: it owns a tokio
//! runtime and blocks on it, which a caller's own async runtime would trip
//! over.
//!
//! `unsafe_code` stays `forbid` here, as in the rest of the workspace. The
//! scaffolding `uniffi::setup_scaffolding!` and `#[uniffi::export]` generate is unsafe by
//! nature — `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] unsafe extern "C"` functions reading raw
//! pointers and `RustBuffer`s from the foreign side — but it is expanded by a
//! macro from another crate, and rustc does not apply the lint to such
//! expansions (checked with uniffi 0.32.2). Code written in this crate is
//! still linted, so `forbid` costs nothing and keeps hand-written `unsafe`
//! out. Should a later uniffi trip the lint, the fix is this crate's own
//! `[lints.rust]` with `unsafe_code = "deny"` and an `allow` on the generated
//! items, not a weaker workspace.
