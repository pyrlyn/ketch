Observed on Windows: `ketch self update` 0.4.4 → 0.5.1 succeeded, but the old binary stayed in the bin dir as `ketch.exe.old`. Windows will not delete the file backing a running image, and at the success cleanup in `replace_binary` (`let _ = std::fs::remove_file(&backup)` after the smoke test) the process doing the deleting is that renamed old image — so the removal fails with access denied and the error is dropped. `install_self`'s aside cleanup has the same silent drop, and a stale `.old` left behind also becomes a destination that can fail the next swap's rename.

Plan: sweep the aside at the start of the self commands instead of at the end of the swap. `self update` and `self install` delete `<bin>/ketch.exe.old` before touching anything: by then any earlier updater process has exited, so the deletion works. Failure stays non-fatal. `doctor` gains a stale-`.old` note for the case where even that fails.

Execution: `aside_candidates` names both leftovers (`ketch.exe.old` from `replace_binary`, `ketch.old` from `install_self` on Windows). `sweep_stale_asides` runs at the start of `update` (not on `--dry-run`) and `install_self`, and `replace_binary` sweeps its own destination again before the rename. A failure warns and continues. The end-of-swap delete stays a single best-effort try: on Windows this process is that image, so the delete cannot succeed until exit. `stale_aside_check` warns from `doctor` when a leftover is still in the bin dir. Tests cover the two names, a sweep that deletes and one that ignores a missing file, and the doctor note.
